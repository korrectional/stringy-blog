In the rapidly evolving world of AI, the conversation around data privacy and control is more important than ever. At Stringy, we believe you should have the power to choose how your valuable professional conversations are processed. That's why Stringy is designed to offer unparalleled flexibility: the option to run your Large Language Models (LLMs) both locally on your device or via robust cloud APIs.

### The Power of Local LLMs: Ultimate Privacy

For professionals where absolute data privacy is paramount, Stringy’s local LLM option is a game-changer. When you process your meeting notes with an LLM running directly on your device:

*   **Your data never leaves your machine:** Every byte of your conversation is processed entirely offline. This eliminates concerns about data transmission to third-party servers, offering maximum security and confidentiality.
*   **Complete control:** You maintain full ownership and control over your AI environment. This is ideal for sensitive discussions, proprietary information, or environments with strict compliance requirements.
*   **Offline capability:** Process notes even without an internet connection, ensuring continuous productivity wherever you are.

This local processing ensures that Stringy acts as your truly private memory assistant, with no compromises on security or discretion.

### The Convenience of Cloud LLMs: Power and Accessibility

While local processing offers ultimate privacy, cloud-based LLMs provide distinct advantages in terms of accessibility, power, and ease of use:

*   **Cutting-edge performance:** Access to the latest and most powerful LLM models, often optimized for speed and accuracy, without requiring high-end local hardware.
*   **Effortless setup:** No complex installations or configurations are needed. Simply connect to an API, and you're ready to go.
*   **Scalability:** Easily handle larger volumes of data or more complex processing tasks, leveraging the vast resources of cloud infrastructure.

Cloud LLMs are an excellent choice for users who prioritize convenience and access to the most advanced AI capabilities, and who are comfortable with industry-standard cloud security protocols.

### Your Choice, Your Control

Stringy is built on the principle of giving you agency. Whether you're a professional handling highly confidential information, or someone who values the simplicity and power of cloud solutions, Stringy adapts to *your* needs.

We empower you to decide:

*   Do you need the impenetrable privacy of local processing?
*   Or do you prefer the cutting-edge capabilities and ease of use offered by cloud APIs?

With Stringy, you get to configure your AI experience, ensuring your meeting notes are handled exactly the way you need them to be – privately, efficiently, and on your terms.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve Stringy, making intelligent conversation management both powerful and uniquely yours.
