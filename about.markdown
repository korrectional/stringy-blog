We are a team of two college students passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. We founded Stringy with a simple goal: to empower professionals to engage more deeply in conversations, confident that every important detail will be privately and intelligently captured. 

We believe that your focus should be on the discussion, not on frantic note-taking. Stringy is our answer to the challenge of information overload, designed to be your discreet and reliable memory assistant. We're dedicated to building tools that enhance productivity and protect your privacy.
